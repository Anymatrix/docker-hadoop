Hadoop headnode includes HDFS namenode & YARN recourcemanager

1. To start Hadoop headnode, you need to create docker network
   (You could change network's name "hadoop-network" on your own)

docker network create hadoop-network

2. Get image of Hadoop headnode

docker pull genok/hadoop-headnode

3. Use following command to create container with Hadoop headnode
   You could use your own container's name (--name=your_own_container_name)
   Replace network's name, if you've changed it at last step (--network)

docker run -p 8020:8020 -p 8088:8088 -p 9870:9870 --network=hadoop-network --name=headnode -d genok/hadoop-headnode

4. Check, that headnode works, in your browser:

http://localhost:8088
http://localhost:9870
