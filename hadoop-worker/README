Hadoop worker includes HDFS datanode, YARN nodemanager

0. You need to have docker network and Hadoop headnode to start Hadoop cluser
   (Manual at genok/hadoop-headnode page)

1. Get image of Hadoop worker

docker pull genok/hadoop-worker

2. Use following command to create container with Hadoop worker
   You could use your own container's name (--name=your_own_container_name)
   Change network's name, if you've your own (--network)

docker run --network=hadoop-network --name=worker -d genok/hadoop-worker

3. Check, that cluster works, in your browser:

http://localhost:8088
http://localhost:9870

You could use more, than 1 worker in your Hadoop cluster
To do it, create new containers with another names, as at step 2
